## The Restaurant Model follows the following data flow:
___
Client Interaction: The client, such as Postman, sends requests to the Localhost server using url provider.

Model Layer: In the model Package we have given all the entities such as ( restaurantID ,restaurantName , restaurantAddress , restaurantPhoneNumber , restaurantSpeciality , totalStaff ,restaurantHasDeliveryService ,restaurantRating) of the restaurant in an restaurant class.

Controller Layer: In the Spring Boot application, the incoming requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

Service Layer: When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer call the Repository layer and returns it back to Controller layer.

Repository Layer : The Repository layer contains the business logic of the application and handles all the task which needed to perform. When a request is received from the Service, the Repository layer performs the necessary actions.

Response: After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Repository layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.
